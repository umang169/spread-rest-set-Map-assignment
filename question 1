// Q 1. Count the occurrences.
// You are building a word count generator that will take a large string of text as input and output the words and
// the number of times they are present in the string. Your task is to write a function that can count the
// occurrences of each word in the string and return a Map containing each word's count. For simplicity, you can
// assume that the string only contains alphabetic characters and spaces.

function wordcount(str){
  const arr = str.split(" ")
  const newmap = new Map()

  for (const word of arr){
    if(newmap.has(word)){
      newmap.set(word,newmap.get(word)+1) 
    }
    else{
      newmap.set(word,1)
    }
  }
  return newmap
  }

console.log(wordcount("hello hi bye umang hello umang"))
